# Vanilla Theme Override - Brazil/Customizable

This Write Everywhere Module targets to override all transit props from the base vanilla themes (North America and Europe) into a customizable setup, defaulting to Brazilian style.

To customize and create your own style:
- At WE window, export the Brazil image atlas;
- Go to exported folder and edit your images;
- Ensure the exported folder is now inside `imageAtlas` folder at WE mod data folder;
- Reload the sprites ingame/restart the game;
- at Templates Setup tab, search by this mod in the list and select your created atlas to replace the original.

The original PSD files for some images are available at GitHub.

Other styles may be added to this module in the future.
